TempDataCleanup PowerShell Module
=================================

Overview:
---------
The TempDataCleanup PowerShell module is designed to clean up temporary files from both user profiles and system folders. It supports local and remote execution, making it useful for freeing up disk space and enhancing system performance across multiple machines. By using this module, you can automate the removal of temporary files, ensuring a cleaner, more efficient environment.


Functionality:
--------------
Invoke-TempDataCleanup:
This core function handles the cleanup of temporary files in user profiles and, optionally, system folders. You can specify whether to clean files only from user directories or to include system-wide temporary directories by using the Full switch. This function supports remote execution through PowerShell remoting.


Parameters:
-----------
- ComputerName (Mandatory): Specifies the computer where the cleanup will be run. Defaults to the local machine (localhost).
- Full (Optional): When this switch is used, system folders (such as Temp, Prefetch, and SoftwareDistribution) will also be cleaned up.


Examples:
---------
# Clean up temporary files from user profiles on the local machine
Invoke-TempDataCleanup -ComputerName "localhost"

# Clean up temporary files from user profiles on a remote computer
Invoke-TempDataCleanup -ComputerName "Computer01"

# Perform a full cleanup (user and system temp files) on the local computer
Invoke-TempDataCleanup -ComputerName "localhost" -Full

# Perform a full cleanup (user and system temp files) on a remote computer
Invoke-TempDataCleanup -ComputerName "Computer01" -Full


Requirements:
-------------
- Windows PowerShell: This module requires PowerShell to run both locally and on remote machines.
- WinRM: Windows Remote Management (WinRM) must be enabled and configured on remote computers to run the function remotely.
- Administrative Privileges: Some tasks, especially those involving system folders, may require administrative rights on the target machine.
- Network Configuration: If using IP addresses or non-standard network setups, ensure proper configuration for remote execution.
