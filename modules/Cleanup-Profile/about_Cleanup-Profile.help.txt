SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The Module `Cleanup-Profile` provides functions to remove a Windows User Profile from a Remote or Local System

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The `Cleanup-Profile` module is designed to facilitate the removal of
    Windows User Profiles from both remote and local systems.
    The module provides a set of functions that automate the process of
    cleaning up user profiles, which includes deleting user profile
    registry keys and renaming or deleting user profile folders.
    This helps in maintaining system hygiene by removing old or unused profiles,
    or assists on setting up a User Profile anew for Troubleshooting purposes.

    Key features of the `Cleanup-Profile` module include:

    - **Remote Profile Cleanup**: Allows administrators to clean up user profiles on remote computers
        without needing to physically access the machine.
    - **Local Profile Cleanup**: Provides functionality to clean up user profiles on the local machine.
    - **Selective Cleanup**: Offers options to skip certain checks, such as installed printers and
        mapped network drives, to tailor the cleanup process to specific needs.
    - **Automated Scripting**: Facilitates the creation of scripts that can be run on multiple machines,
        making it easier to manage user profiles across a large network.

    Remote functions may also work on Local Machine if executing User is not the UserProfile being
    cleaned up and WinRM is set up accordingly
